# PHN Tech Projects

## Overview  
This repository showcases the projects completed during a two-month online web development internship, with a focus on front-end development, at PHN Technology. The journey began with creating a basic table booking form and progressed to designing complete front-end interfaces for community, travel, and hospital websites.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript (basic)**  

## Key Highlights  
- Developed interfaces emphasizing user-centric design principles.  
- Ensured **complete responsiveness** across devices.  
- Achieved **seamless navigation** for enhanced user experience.  
- Crafted **thoughtfully designed user interfaces** with attention to detail.  

This experience has honed my understanding of design principles, element arrangement, and the implementation of responsive web designs. The skills gained here have served as a foundation for tackling more advanced projects in the future.
